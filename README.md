The goal of this project is to accurately predict demand for Walmart stores. This may be useful for anticipating unforeseen demands where product may run out of stock or be in surplus and expire. Using economic features such as CPI, unemployment indexes, and other features like temperature and whether the day is a holiday, a machine learning algorithm may be able to predict demand. This dataset is challenging to work with because of the prevalence of holidays and its cyclical nature. 

The working plan of this project is to:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset using PowerBI, determining the defining properties of the data and identifying how the machine learning model and doing any possible cleaning. A preliminary report will also be generated to showcase why the planned design will be used.
2. Develop the machine learning model using PyTorch and Google Colab.
3. Produce a final report on the efficacy of the model, the predictions for the next year for each store and overall, and any recommended actions for Walmart.
